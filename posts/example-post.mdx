Software engineering can’t be labeled as simply programming. The major differences between the two have to do with thinking about the future, 
the complexity and size of a project. Software engineering isn’t programming but programming is a part of software engineering. 
If you want a program to stay alive for a long time, it has to be able to adapt to the possible changes that appear, otherwise it's not a sustainable program.
 Another aspect of software engineering that is important is how many people are working on the project, not only that but what is at stake, code wise. 
 Ultimately, time will tell if your software is adaptable enough to survive the future since there isn’t one simple test to ensure viability.
