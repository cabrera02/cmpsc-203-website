SE 3 - Programs are a team effort, one person may have come up with the idea but for successful projects, one person doesn’t remain the sole coder. Programs are created on a bigger scale with lots of people participating and perfecting the program. To succeed, a software engineer must write many test cases to ensure the longevity of a project. With this, also comes more expenses, meaning more money needs to be provided to take a project to its final stages.

FB 3 - Fuzzers were created in a University class after a professor’s program crashed. The assignment was to create random outputs and see what it would take to break a program. This is what led to the fuzzer( ) function being created. While fuzzer are commonly seen as just random unstructured outputs, there is a way to make the outputs less random.
